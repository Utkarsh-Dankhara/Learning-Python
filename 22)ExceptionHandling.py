'''
So you might think why even use finally when you can use a normal statement outside the try-except

Well when this thing is in a function then you might wanna return a value and finally won't execute, so to return a value as well as execute the finally statement we use this.

Finally means it will execute even though you want a value returned from the function, normally after returning it should just break but finally will execute no matter what'''
